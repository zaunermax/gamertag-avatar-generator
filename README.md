This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- this project uses pnpm (>= 8)

### Installation

pnpm install
```

and then start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## How did I do this?

I basically feeded GPT-4 with some documentation on how to create the perfect DALL-E
prompts. Then i made it generate at least 5 prompts per gaming genre. The genres were also
generated by GPT-4.

The full prompt is the following:

```
Now act like a professional DALL-E prompt engineer and take into account all the
information I just provided on how to create the perfect DALL-E prompt.

Your task now is to create DALL-E prompts to create an avatar image for a gamertag. Come
up with some cool ideas of some prompts with have something to do with gaming. Come up
with at least 10 distinct areas that have something to do with gaming, like FPS, RPGs,
anmine and so on and give me 3 prompts per area.

Output the promtps in form of a Javascript array of strings and the strings are the
prompts. The gamertag substitution string should be "{{gamerTag}}"
```

I saved a lot of tokens by copying pieces of the prompt documentation and then telling
GPT-4 to respond with "READ" to it's answer as short as possible.

I then copied the output to my code and used the users' inputs to generate random images
for their gamer tags. This project is using the `openai` npm package to generate images
with DALL-E.
